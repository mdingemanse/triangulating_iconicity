Some words sound like what they mean, or show *iconicity*: aspects of their forms resemble aspects of their meanings. This makes them communicatively useful, easier to learn, and easier to guess even for people who don't speak the language. Here we look at the iconicity of 239 such words from three different perspectives: We have experimental measures of their guessability from prior published work; (ii) we have coded a number of iconic form-meaning mappings in order to capture iconicity in a theoretically grounded way; and (iii) we have collected iconicity ratings. We triangulate these measures of iconicity in order to learn more about their strenghts and weaknesses, and in order to contribute to a more holistic, empirically grounded, theoretically informed, experimentally robust understanding of iconicity.
